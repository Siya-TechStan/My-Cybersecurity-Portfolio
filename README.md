# My-Cybersecurity-Portfolio
As part of my cybersecurity journey, I have created a rigorous cybersecurity projects portfolio. These projects will encompass the most common industry tools ranging from Linux, SQL, Python, SIEMs, (Splunk) Snort, Nmap and Wireshark. I will also be covering cloud security on both AWS and Azure platforms.
